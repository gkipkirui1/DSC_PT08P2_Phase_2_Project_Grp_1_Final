    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our company recognizes the growing trend among major industry players in producing original video content and intends to establish a new movie studio to capitalize on this opportunity. However, we currently lack the necessary expertise and insights into filmmaking. To effectively guide the studio's development, we have been assigned the task of investigating the types of films that are currently excelling at the box office. The challenge lies in not only identifying these successful film trends but also converting this information into practical recommendations that the studio's leadership can use to make informed decisions about future film productions. Failure to do so may result in misguided investments and an inability to compete in the market.\n",

    "# Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "  * What are the trends in movie release dates and what impact do they have on revenue?\n",
    "  * Is there a relationship between production budget and profitability and ROI of a movie? i.e Does a higher production budget automatically result to  a higher profitability and vice versa.\n",
    "  * Determine which film genres are currently performing best at the box office.\n",
    "  * Look at trends in audience preferences and box office performance over recent years.\n",
    "  * Understand Audience Demographics by identifying the demographics of audiences for top-performing genres.\n",
    "  * Evaluate production costs associated with different genres.\n",
    "  * Understand the relationship between production cost and revenue streams of movies\n",
    "  * Evaluate the if movie rating affect production costs.\n",
    "  * Provide actionable insights for the new movie studio.\n",
