# Project Overview



# Business Problem

Our company recognizes the growing trend among major industry players in producing original video content and intends to establish a new movie studio to capitalize on this opportunity. However, we currently lack the necessary expertise and insights into filmmaking. To effectively guide the studio's development, we have been assigned the task of investigating the types of films that are currently excelling at the box office. The challenge lies in not only identifying these successful film trends but also converting this information into practical recommendations that the studio's leadership can use to make informed decisions about future film productions. Failure to do so may result in misguided investments and an inability to compete in the market.

# Business Objectives

  * What are the trends in movie release dates and what impact do they have on revenue?
  * Is there a relationship between production budget and profitability and ROI of a movie? i.e Does a higher production budget automatically result to  a higher profitability and vice versa.
  * Determine which film genres are currently performing best at the box office.
  * Look at trends in audience preferences and box office performance over recent years.
  * Understand Audience Demographics by identifying the demographics of audiences for top-performing genres.
  * Evaluate production costs associated with different genres.
  * Understand the relationship between production cost and revenue streams of movies
  * Evaluate the if movie rating affect production costs.
  * Provide actionable insights for the new movie studio.

## Overview
## Project Overview

For this project, we used exploratory data analysis to generate insights for the business stakeholder.

## Business Understanding
          ****Include stakeholder and key business questions***

### Business Problem

Our company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### The Source of data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Because it was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or `pd.read_csv`, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

# Data
The data used for this project include:
  * [movie_gross]( )
  * [movie_budget]( )
  * [movie_info]( )
  * [im.db]( )
  

# Data Understanding

# The Libraries 
The files are built-in and can only be accessed once they are imported into the library.
The libraries used in the project are listed below:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib_inline
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import statsmodels.api as sm
import zipfile
import os
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import pearsonr, ttest_ind
from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import linear_rainbow
sns.set_style()

# Loading of the data
The data was loaded in two ways: from CSV files and from a database. The CSV files were located in the unzipped directory, where ./Data/dsc-phase-2-project-v3-main.zip was extracted. Within this directory, the zippedData folder contained various datasets. Additionally, data was loaded directly from the database.

   * movie_budget = pd.read_csv("unzipped/dsc-phase-2-project-v3-main/zippedData/tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz")
   * movie_gross = pd.read_csv("unzipped/dsc-phase-2-project-v3-main/zippedData/bom.movie_gross.csv.gz")
   * movie_info = pd.read_csv("unzipped/dsc-phase-2-project-v3-main/zippedData/rt.movie_info.tsv.gz", sep='\t', encoding='ISO-8859-1')

* #create a connection to the database
  conn = sqlite3.connect("im.db")

  #create a cursor
  cur = conn.cursor()

  #Check the table names for our database
  pd.read_sql("""SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';""", conn)


# Description of data
* Movie_info  
   * All the ID column details are 1560 with none missing, datatypes are integer(1) and object(11)
   * The number of rows and columns are 1560 , 12 in number. 
   * The mean of the unique data in movie_info was 1007.30.
   * The standard deviation of the ID column in movie_info was 579.16. This shows how data deviates from the mean.
   * The minimum value of ID is 1 with the maximum being 2000
  
* Movie_budget
   * The data has 5782 rows with none with missing values.
   * The data has 5 columns with text type of data while the ID column has integer data type.
   * ID column in Movie_budget has 5782 unique values counted.
   * The mean of the unique data in movie_budget was 50.37.
   * The standard deviation of the ID column in movie_budget was 28.82. This shows how data deviates from the mean.
   * The minimum value of ID is 1 with the maximum being 100.
  
* Movie_gross
    * The data has 3387 rows with title column having no missing values. Title is the unique identifier in the dataset.
    * The data has 3 columns(title,studio,foreign_gross) with text type of data, the domestic_gross and year columns have floats and integer data types, respectively.
    * The standard deviation of domestic gross for the movies was about 67 million dollars, showing a large spread
    * The 75th percentile of the domestic gross was 2.79 million dollars with the median at 1.2 million dollars. This shows that the 75% of the movies have a domestic gross less than 2.79 million dollars. 25% of the movies have a domestic gross of less than 1.2 million dollars.
    * The minimum domestic gross value for the movies was 100 dollars , the maximum domestic gross value stood at 936.7 million dollars.


# Cleaning of the data 
* Movie_info
    * Finding the sum of the missing values, calculating its percentage  and dropping columns with missing values above 50%.

### Description of data
          ****Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)***

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of the new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **non-technical presentation**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**

### Non-Technical Presentation

The non-technical presentation is a slide deck presenting your analysis to business stakeholders.

* ***Non-technical*** does not mean that you should avoid mentioning the technologies or techniques that you used, it means that you should explain any mentions of these technologies and avoid assuming that your audience is already familiar with them.
* ***Business stakeholders*** means that the audience for your presentation is the company, not the class or teacher. Do not assume that they are already familiar with the specific business problem.

The presentation describes the project ***goals, data, methods, and results***. It has included at least ***three visualizations*** which correspond to ***three business recommendations***.

We have used the following:

1. Beginning
    * Overview
    * Business Understanding
2. Middle
    * Data Understanding
    * Data Analysis
3. End
    * Recommendations
    * Next Steps
    * Thank You
       * This slide should include a prompt for questions as well as your contact information (name and LinkedIn profile)
