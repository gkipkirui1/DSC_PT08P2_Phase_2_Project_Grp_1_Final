## Overview
## Project Overview

For this project, we used exploratory data analysis to generate insights for the business stakeholder.

## Business Understanding
          ****Include stakeholder and key business questions***

### Business Problem

Our company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### The Source of data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Because it was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or `pd.read_csv`, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

Note that the above diagram shows ONLY the IMDB data. You will need to look carefully at the features to figure out how the IMDB data relates to the other provided data files.

### Description of data
          ****Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)***

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of the new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **non-technical presentation**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**

### Non-Technical Presentation

The non-technical presentation is a slide deck presenting your analysis to business stakeholders.

* ***Non-technical*** does not mean that you should avoid mentioning the technologies or techniques that you used, it means that you should explain any mentions of these technologies and avoid assuming that your audience is already familiar with them.
* ***Business stakeholders*** means that the audience for your presentation is the company, not the class or teacher. Do not assume that they are already familiar with the specific business problem.

The presentation describes the project ***goals, data, methods, and results***. It has included at least ***three visualizations*** which correspond to ***three business recommendations***.

We have used the following:

1. Beginning
    * Overview
    * Business Understanding
2. Middle
    * Data Understanding
    * Data Analysis
3. End
    * Recommendations
    * Next Steps
    * Thank You
       * This slide should include a prompt for questions as well as your contact information (name and LinkedIn profile)
